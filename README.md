This repo contains the presentation during my Internship at IIT Madras

During the internship, I mainly did Literature Review and Understanding of Control and Error Reduction in CNC Units
I followed the book Manufacturing Automation by Prof. Yusuf Altintas (University of British Columbia) to gain understanding of the subject

During my internship, I also got the opportunity to learn the Virtual CNC software which could be used to accurately visualize the actual path followed by -
CNC spindle when fed with appropriate Controllers, Velocity and Accleration control graphs and other models such as Friction and Active Damping models
